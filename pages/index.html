				<p class="lead">The Norse IoT club is focused on student-led
					research and projects concerning Internet of Things devices and
					applications. We hope to foster a community for students, faculty,
					alumni, and industry professionals who are enthusiastic about the
					opportunities IoT has to offer.
				</p>
				<p>The purpose and objectives of the club are to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Share knowledge and ideas among students, faculty, and industry.</li>
					<li>Establish a playground for IoT &amp; Industry 4.0.</li>
					<li>Develop skills outside of the standard university curriculum.</li>
					<li>Foster an innovative and entrepreneurial environment.</li>
					<li>Partner with industry pros working on real-world practical projects.</li>
					<li>Create an environment for work, tinkering &amp; socializing.</li>
				</ul>
				<div><span style="display: block;">Club members will perform hands-on projects with a variety of
						technologies, such as </span>
					<details>
						<summary>microcontrollers </summary> (ESP-32)
					</details>,
					<details>
						<summary>sensors</summary> (LIDAR, ultrasonic, infrared, temperature, humidity, etc.)
